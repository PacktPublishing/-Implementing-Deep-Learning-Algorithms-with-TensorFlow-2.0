# Implementing-Deep-Learning-Algorithms-with-TensorFlow-2.0

This is the code repository for [Implementing Deep Learning Algorithms with TensorFlow 2.0 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/implementing-deep-learning-algorithms-tensorflow-20-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
Deep Learning has caused the revival of Artificial Intelligence. It has become the dominant method for speech recognition (Google Assistant), computer vision (search for "my pictures" on Google Photos), language translation, and even game-related Artificial Intelligence (think AlphaGo and DeepMind). If you'd like to learn how these systems work and maybe make your own, Deep Learning is for you! 

In this course, you’ll gain a solid understanding of Deep Learning models and use Deep Learning techniques to solve business and other real-world problems to make predictions quickly and easily. You’ll learn various Deep Learning approaches such as CNN, RNN, and LSTM and implement them with TensorFlow 2.0. You’ll program a model to classify breast cancer, predict stock market prices, process text as part of Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more. 

By the end of this course, you’ll have a complete understanding to use the power of TensorFlow 2.0 to train Deep Learning models of varying complexities, without any hassle.
